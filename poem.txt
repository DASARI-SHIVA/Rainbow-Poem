'The Rainbow' symbolizes the life sustaining and life nourishing goodness of Nature. The sight of the beautiful rainbow which Wordsworth saw when he was only a child is deeply etched in his memory and the same joy that he experienced when he saw it as a child, contiunes to remain with him through his adulthood.
